UI/UX Guidelines for Checkout Page

1. Validation Messages:
   - All form validation errors (e.g., missing name, invalid email) must be displayed in RED text.
   - Error messages should appear immediately below the input field.

2. Buttons:
   - The "Pay Now" button must be colored GREEN (#008000 or similar) to indicate the primary action.
   - "Add to Cart" buttons should be clearly visible.

3. Success Feedback:
   - Upon successful form submission, the system must display the message "Payment Successful!"
   - The success message needs to be distinct and visible without reloading the page.
